# Local Mac execution

Read `AGENTS.md` first. This document covers the local-Mac execution path: how a Linear work item becomes a running agent in an isolated git worktree on this machine, and what every worker (human or agent) needs to know about that environment. It replaces the former per-platform operator guides (`claude-code.md`, `codex.md`) and the cloud-orchestrator model (`codex-orchestration.md`, `multi-platform-dispatch-policy.md`), which are retained under `docs/operators/archive/` as historical reference.

> **This is the Mac execution adapter's operator guide — one of two adapters, not the whole execution model.** `docs/governance/hybrid-execution-architecture.md` is the authoritative architecture: Linear owns desired lifecycle state, GitHub owns delivered state, and eligible non-iOS work may route to a Linear-managed **cloud** adapter instead of this one. Everything below remains accurate and current for the Mac lane, which is permanent — iOS/Xcode work can only run here. The cloud adapter is decided but **not enabled** (gated on `MOV-141`); until then this is the only live adapter.

See `docs/governance/linear-information-architecture.md` for the Linear workspace design this path is driven by, and `docs/operators/worker-routing.md` for how a worker binary and model are selected per issue.

## What changed from the cloud-agent model

The previous system assumed agents ran in degraded cloud containers: no `gh` CLI, GitHub GraphQL blocked by a network proxy, no Docker, no persistent local state. None of that applies here. This Mac has a full `gh` install, direct GitHub API access, a real filesystem, and a real process supervisor. Do not carry forward workarounds written for that constrained environment — they produce strictly worse behavior locally (e.g. avoiding `gh` in favor of a comment-command workflow when `gh` is simply available).

**Not to be confused with the new cloud adapter.** The "cloud-agent model" retired above is the old multi-platform GitHub-Project-era arrangement (Cursor Cloud, Copilot, cloud Codex) — a different thing from the Linear-managed Coding Session adapter introduced in `docs/governance/hybrid-execution-architecture.md`. The lesson that survives is narrow and still applies: never assume an execution environment's capabilities; both adapters are defined by an explicit contract and an explicit capability table, not by assumption.

```

Dispatcher code lives in `tools/dispatcher/` in this repository (TypeScript, using the repo's existing Node 24 + Vitest toolchain). Runtime config lives outside the repo at `~/.config/moviecal/` (mode 700) — API keys and `.env.local` must never be committed. Run logs live at `~/Library/Logs/moviecal-dispatcher/`, retained 90 days.

## Dispatch trigger

The dispatcher polls Linear for issues in workflow state `Ready for Agent` that are delegated to it. (A future phase may register a Linear Agent App for webhook-driven dispatch instead of polling; both share the same downstream pipeline.)

## Automated promotion

`Ready for Agent` is filled automatically, not by hand (MOV-129). Each poll cycle, before the dispatch scan, `dispatcher run` runs a **promote pass** (`tools/dispatcher/src/promoter.mjs`; also standalone as `dispatcher promote [--dry-run]`) over every issue in `Backlog` and `Blocked`. An issue is moved to `Ready for Agent` when **all** of:

- it is **not** labeled `human-only`;
- its description has a non-empty **acceptance-criteria** section (heading matching `/^#+\s*acceptance criteria/i`);
- its description has a non-empty **Testing Expectations** section (`/^#+\s*testing expectations/i`);
- every issue that `blocks` it is in a completed/canceled state (`Done`, `Released`, `Canceled`, `Duplicate`), resolved via the same `inverseRelations` data the dependency gate uses.

For a `Blocked` issue there is one extra condition: its most recent `**Dispatcher preflight failed:**` comment must name an unresolved-relation reason (now resolved). An issue blocked for any other reason — a missing secret, a worktree collision, a human's decision — is left alone.

On promotion the promoter comments `Auto-promoted to Ready for Agent — …` (which, via the app-actor identity from MOV-122, notifies the repo owner). It is idempotent: a promoted issue is no longer in `Backlog`/`Blocked`, so a second pass does nothing.

Before promotion, the issue must also carry exactly one materialized
`execution:{cloud,mac,none}` label. The dispatcher infers routes for dry-run
and classification purposes, but does not silently write or dispatch an
unmaterialized inference. `execution:none` is reserved for issues labeled
`type:coordination`; those coordination parents are intentionally excluded
from the automated promoter because they must not produce their own PR.

**What the dispatcher does with each route, today:**

| Materialized route | Dispatch behaviour |
|---|---|
| `execution:mac` | Runs on this Mac adapter as described in this document. |
| `execution:cloud` | **Not executable yet.** The dispatcher moves the issue to `Needs Human Decision` with a comment ("the Linear-managed cloud adapter is not enabled yet") and does not create a worktree. Stays this way until the cloud lane is piloted (`MOV-153`–`MOV-155`, `docs/governance/hybrid-execution-architecture.md` §Rollout gates). Until then, do not label routable work `execution:cloud` expecting it to run. |
| `execution:none` | Moved to `Needs Human Decision` with a "skipped coordination issue" comment; never produces a PR. If a `type:coordination` parent genuinely needs code, split the work into a child issue with its own route — the parent stays `execution:none`. |
| invalid / missing / conflicting | Moved to `Needs Human Decision` naming the specific problem (`resolveExecutionRoute` in `tools/dispatcher/src/execution-routing.mjs`). |

`blocks` relations plus the preflight gates below do all **sequencing**; the promoter only judges **readiness**. There is no per-issue human promotion step. To hold a specced issue out of the automated flow, move it to `Spec Ready` — the promoter never touches that state.

## Preflight gates

Before starting work on an issue, all of the following must pass, or the issue moves to `Blocked` with a comment naming the failed gate:

1. No unresolved `blocked by` relations.
2. Not labeled `human-only`.
3. Not labeled `needs-secrets` unless the named local secret is actually present.
4. If the issue is in the **iOS Companion App** project: the self-hosted macOS runner (`moviecal-ios-runner`, labels `self-hosted, macOS, ios`) is online.
5. A concurrency slot is free (default: 2 simultaneous worktrees).
6. `origin/master` is fetched and the target worktree path is unused.

## Worktree lifecycle

- **Path:** `~/code/worktrees/moviecal/<LINEAR-ID>-<slug>`
- **Branch:** `agent/<LINEAR-ID>-<slug>`, branched from `origin/master`
- The Linear issue identifier appears in both the path and the branch name, so ownership is always unambiguous from either side.
- Ownership is recorded in `~/.config/moviecal/worktrees.json`: identifier, branch, PID, worker, model, start time, Linear issue URL.
- `.env.local` is a **symlink** to `~/.config/moviecal/env.local`, never a copy — one file to rotate, and no credential material ever lands inside a git-tracked tree.
- **Cleanup:** on merge, the worktree is removed and the remote branch deleted. On failure, the worktree is retained for 7 days for inspection, then pruned. `dispatcher gc` (also runnable manually) prunes stale entries and orphaned worktrees.
- **Reconciliation (`pr-reconcile.mjs`):** once a worker's PR is found, the worktree entry records `prNumber`/`prUrl` alongside its `"review"` status. Every `dispatcher run` poll cycle (via `cmdRunOnce`, before processing new issues) sweeps every worktree in `"review"` and checks its PR's real state (`gh pr view <n> --json state,mergedAt`): merged → marked `"merged"` (so the next `gc` cleans it up); closed without merging → marked `"abandoned"` (7-day retention path, same as a worker failure). Before this existed, a merged PR's worktree just sat there indefinitely — nothing watched it after `"review"` — and had to be cleaned up by hand (found during `MOV-117` cleanup, fixed by `MOV-118`). Linear's own state generally transitions separately via the GitHub magic-word sync (`Fixes MOV-NNN` in the PR body) once merged; this reconciliation only owns the local worktree bookkeeping.
- Agents must not commit directly to `master`, and never operate outside their assigned worktree.

## Worker interface

A worker is any binary satisfying: *given a repo path, a branch, and a brief on stdin, produce commits on that branch and exit 0.* Concretely, `claude -p --model <id>` or `codex exec --sandbox workspace-write`. Adding a third worker means writing one adapter, not a new operator guide, a new branch prefix, and edits to every CI workflow's `branches:` filter.

A worker invocation is one-shot — there is no resume across turns, so the brief (`brief.mjs`) explicitly tells the worker to run verification (`npm run verify`, `xcodebuild`, etc.) synchronously and never background a long-running build/test and exit expecting to check on it later (`MOV-137`, after `MOV-106`'s first dispatch did exactly that and left an orphaned `xcodebuild test` running after the worker exited 0). As a backstop, `worker-spawn.mjs` spawns the worker detached (its own process group) and, once it exits, signals the whole group (`SIGTERM` then `SIGKILL` after a grace period) so nothing it spawned outlives it, and `run-loop.mjs` reports a worker that exits 0 with an unclean worktree and no PR as `abandoned-dirty` (naming the uncommitted paths in the Linear comment) rather than the generic `no-pr`.

## Branch and CI conventions

Branch prefixes are the machine-readable registry in `docs/operators/branch-prefixes.json`, enforced against CI workflow `branches:` filters by `npm run check:branch-ci`. Current prefixes:

- `agent/**` — all agent-authored implementation work (any worker binary)
- `docs/**` — documentation/governance-only changes
- `chore/**` — maintenance changes not tied to a specific Linear issue

Run `npm run check:branch-ci` after any change to `branch-prefixes.json` or a workflow's `branches:` filter — it is also enforced in `verify.yml`.

## Reporting back to Linear

At each transition the dispatcher writes to the Linear issue:

| Transition | Linear update |
|---|---|
| Delegated, dispatcher picks it up | State → `Agent Working`; comment with worktree path, branch, worker, model |
| Worker has a question it cannot resolve | State → `Needs Input`; comment with the question |
| Verification runs | Comment with lane results (`npm run verify`, browser lane if applicable) |
| PR opened | State → `In Review`; comment with PR link |
| CI completes | Comment with check conclusions |
| PR merges | State → `Done` (automatic, via the GitHub magic word, e.g. `Fixes MOV-123`) |
| Worker fails or hits a hard-deny action | State → `Blocked` or `Needs Human Decision`; comment with the last ~50 log lines and the run-log path |

No agent conversation is a source of truth. Anything that matters must be written to Linear or to the repository before the session ends.

## Security model

**What's actually GitHub-enforced today (verified 2026-09-04, ruleset last updated 2026-09-08):** direct pushes to `master` are rejected at the git protocol level (`GH013`); force-push and branch deletion are blocked; merging requires going through a PR with `lane-baseline`, `lane-unit`, `lane-integration`, `lane-browser`, and (since MOV-119) `lane-review` all passing; `bypass_actors: []` means even the repo owner can't override this via GitHub's admin-merge option. None of that depends on a worker reading a file — it's the `master-protection` ruleset (see `docs/technical/`), and GitHub itself rejects the attempt regardless of who or what makes it. An agent never runs `gh pr merge --admin`; it enables GitHub auto-merge and lets the ruleset gate the actual merge.

**What is *not* yet GitHub-enforced, and is honest to name as a gap:** `master-protection`'s `pull_request` rule sets `required_approving_review_count: 0` (see `docs/planning/decision-log.md` Stage 9/9b) — every PR today is authored under the repo owner's own GitHub credentials, and GitHub blocks a PR author from approving their own PR, so requiring a review today would deadlock the queue rather than add scrutiny. This is deliberately **not** being fixed by adding a formal review-approval step: GitHub's own Copilot code review never posts an "Approve", specifically so it can't satisfy `required_approving_review_count` — a same-family bot approving its own sibling's PR would just be a rubber stamp under a different identity, not real independent scrutiny, and would need a second GitHub credential to provision and secure for no real gain. Instead, `MOV-116` adds an automated independent review pass as a **required status check** (`lane-review`, see below), the pattern proven at scale by Devin Review and CodeRabbit: fully unattended, no approval semantics, no second identity. `required_approving_review_count` stays `0` permanently under this design — there is no approval step to require.
More importantly: **the "hard deny" list below is not currently enforced by anything GitHub would reject** — a worker process uses the repo owner's own `gh`/git credentials, which have enough scope to edit or delete the very ruleset described above. Today, "don't touch the ruleset" is a written instruction the worker is expected to read and honor (this file, `AGENTS.md`), not a technical control. `MOV-116` also covers wiring `security-policy.mjs`'s hard-deny classifier into real enforcement — that part is unresolved and independent of the review-lane work below.

**`lane-review` (added 2026-09-08, required status check since 2026-09-08 — MOV-119):** `scripts/lane-review.mjs`, run by `.github/workflows/review-verify.yml` on every PR. Two layers: heuristic checks (sensitive paths — `.github/workflows/**`, `AGENTS.md`, `.claude/settings*.json`, `docs/product/**`, ruleset-shaped filenames; secret-shaped strings; diff-size threshold) that always run and need no credential; an AI review pass (a fresh Claude call, strict reviewer-only prompt) that runs only when the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` repo secret is present. It fails the check (never posts a GitHub review/approval, only a plain PR comment for visibility) on any blocking finding.

**Acknowledging a legitimate sensitive-path change (MOV-134).** A sensitive-path hit is a `block` by default, and with `bypass_actors: []` that means the PR cannot merge at all — so a real change to one of those paths needs an explicit, auditable sign-off. The repo owner records it by adding the **`sensitive-path-ack` label** to the PR **and** a **`lane-review-ack: <reason>`** line to the PR body. With both present, `lane-review` downgrades the sensitive-path finding from `block` to `warn` (still printed, still in the summary comment). One without the other still blocks, and the message names what is missing. This mirrors MOV-121's workflow-edit authorization (label + marker, fail closed) and is deliberately narrow: **secret-detection and diff-size blocks are never downgradeable this way**, and the acknowledgement is per-PR, visible in the PR's own metadata.

It ran informationally (not required) for its first several PRs before being promoted: zero false positives across 8 PRs, spanning docs-only changes, dispatcher-internal code, and one substantial real app-code PR (`MOV-104`/#281, 711 additions across 15 files) — every `pass` was legitimate and every `block` was a genuine workflow-file touch (`#272`, `#279`, `#281`'s applied-workflow commit). The AI layer's first live run (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` was configured partway through, on `#281`) produced two well-calibrated non-blocking `warn`-level findings (a placeholder bundle identifier, a hardcoded simulator destination) rather than overreaching to `block` — exactly the "flag, don't overreach" behavior it's designed for. On that evidence, `lane-review` was added to `master-protection`'s required status checks (now 5 of 5, alongside `lane-baseline`/`lane-unit`/`lane-integration`/`lane-browser`) via a direct `PUT` to the ruleset API — a repo owner action, not something the dispatcher or a worker ever does (ruleset/branch-protection changes stay on the hard-deny list unconditionally, see below).

**Credentials** — none live in the repository:

| Credential | Location | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub | `gh` keyring auth on this Mac | already scoped |
| Linear API key | `~/.config/moviecal/linear.env` (mode 600) | scoped to team `MOV` |
| Linear app-actor credential | `~/.config/moviecal/linear-app.env` (mode 600) | OAuth2 Client Credentials for the `moviecal-dispatcher` workspace identity (MOV-122); keys `LINEAR_APP_CLIENT_ID`, `LINEAR_APP_CLIENT_SECRET`, `LINEAR_APP_ACTOR_ID`, `LINEAR_APP_SCOPES` (`read,write,app:assignable,app:mentionable`). Optional during the transition — when absent the dispatcher falls back to the personal API key above. |
| Test `.env.local` | `~/.config/moviecal/env.local` (mode 600) | disposable/dev Supabase + TMDb credentials only |
| `SUPABASE_DB_URL_PROD` | GitHub Actions secret | never available to a local worker |

**Hard deny — the dispatcher refuses and escalates to `Needs Human Decision`:**

- Force-push anything; push to `master`; delete a branch other than its own
- Modify `.github/workflows/**`, GitHub rulesets, or branch protection
- `gh secret set`; echo any env var matching `*KEY*|*TOKEN*|*SECRET*|*PASSWORD*`
- Any command referencing `SUPABASE_DB_URL_PROD`; `supabase db reset`
- `vercel --prod`; `gh release create`; `npm publish`
- Edit `AGENTS.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, or `docs/product/**`

For a Claude worker, this list is now partially enforced by `.claude/settings.json`'s `permissions.deny` rules — a real technical layer Claude Code's own harness checks before a tool call runs, not something that depends on the model choosing to comply (verified: rules are evaluated deny-then-ask-then-allow, and a deny rule can't be carved out by a more specific allow). That's a step up from pure documentation, but it isn't as strong as the GitHub-ruleset category above: Bash pattern matching is prefix/substring-based and documented as fragile against creative command construction, it only covers what the worker invokes *through Claude Code's own tools* (a raw `curl` to the GitHub API instead of `gh` isn't covered), and Codex has no equivalent settings file at all yet — it relies on `--sandbox workspace-write`, a different and less granular mechanism. `MOV-116` is still the plan for closing the gap properly.

Two operational prerequisites for a Claude worker to run headlessly at all, discovered and confirmed empirically while wiring this up:

- **Workspace trust.** Claude Code refuses to apply `.claude/settings.json` in an untrusted workspace. This is anchored to the repository's **main checkout path**, not to whichever worktree a session runs from: trusting a linked worktree's own path did *not* stop the "workspace has not been trusted" warning for a `-p` session run from it; trusting the main checkout did, and that one grant covers every worktree of the repo. `WorktreeManager.create()` (`tools/dispatcher/src/worktree-manager.mjs`) pre-trusts both the new worktree's own path and the discovered main-checkout path (via `mainWorktreePath()`, parsed from `git worktree list --porcelain`) using `tools/dispatcher/src/claude-trust.mjs`'s `trustWorkspace()` — a careful read-modify-write of `~/.claude.json` that touches only the one project key, preserving everything else. This is safe specifically because it only ever runs on paths the dispatcher itself just checked out from this same repository, never an arbitrary path. Failure is non-fatal and logged: an untrusted workspace still fails cleanly rather than hanging (see below).
- **A current login.** The `claude` CLI's own login must be valid (`claude` then `/login` if expired) — this can only be done interactively, never by an agent.

**Staged workflow-edit proposals (MOV-121, added 2026-09-08).** `Edit(.github/workflows/**)` in the hard-deny list above is never lifted, for any issue, ever — that stays exactly as strict as documented. But some legitimate issues (e.g. a CI-cutover task like `MOV-104`, converting `ios-verify.yml` from bootstrap no-op to real `xcodebuild`/XCTest CI) genuinely need to change a workflow file as their whole point, and the repo owner wants issues like that handled fully by an agent in one PR, not split into "agent scaffolds, human hand-applies the CI diff." A permission carve-out can't do this safely: rules are evaluated deny-then-allow with **deny always winning regardless of specificity** (verified above), so a narrower "allow this one file" rule layered on top of the blanket deny would be silently ignored — and even removing the blanket deny and denying every *currently-existing* workflow filename individually leaves a gap, since a worker could create a brand-new file under `.github/workflows/` that wouldn't match any of the enumerated denies.

Instead, a human applies the `ci:workflow-edit-authorized` label to an issue and adds exactly one `Workflow-edit: <path>` marker to its description (e.g. `Workflow-edit: .github/workflows/ios-verify.yml`) — `resolveWorkflowEditAuthorization()` in `preflight.mjs` fails the whole issue closed (moves it to `Blocked`) if the label and marker don't both agree on exactly one valid `.github/workflows/*.yml` path, rather than silently proceeding either under- or over-scoped. When authorized, the worker's brief (`brief.mjs`) tells it to write the file's full proposed content to `tools/dispatcher/pending-workflow-edits/<filename>` — an ordinary, unrestricted path — instead of editing the real one. After the worker exits successfully, `workflow-edit-apply.mjs`'s `applyStagedWorkflowEdit()` — the dispatcher's own trusted orchestration code, which was never subject to `.claude/settings.json` in the first place (that file only governs the `claude` CLI subprocess) — copies the staged content into the real path, removes the staging file, and commits+pushes the result onto the worker's own branch, before the PR is checked for.

Crucially, this doesn't weaken review: the resulting PR still visibly contains the workflow diff, and `lane-review`'s existing sensitive-path heuristic still flags any diff touching `.github/workflows/**` as requiring explicit human sign-off before merge — the same gate any other issue's workflow-touching PR would hit. What changes is only *who proposes and builds the change* (an agent, working under real hard-deny protection throughout, never gaining the ability to directly write to that path), not *whether it's reviewed before merging*.

Separately: the worker previously had no `xcodebuild`/`xcrun simctl` in its Bash allowlist at all, so it couldn't verify an iOS build even once permitted to touch the workflow. `Bash(xcodebuild *)` / `Bash(xcrun simctl *)` are now allowed globally in `.claude/settings.json` — safe to allow unconditionally, unlike the workflow-edit case, since running a build/test is not itself governance-sensitive.

**Always requires a human (`Needs Human Decision`):**

- Database migrations touching existing tables
- Auth or calendar-token logic changes
- Anything adding a new secret
- Any production deploy or release
- Any change to this governance system itself

## Run-log locations

Dispatcher and worker run logs are written to `~/Library/Logs/moviecal-dispatcher/<LINEAR-ID>-<slug>/`, one directory per worktree, containing the full worker stdout/stderr and a `manifest.json` (worker, model, start/end time, exit code, PR URL if opened). Logs are retained for 90 days and then pruned by `dispatcher gc`. Given a Linear issue, the corresponding run log directory can always be found from the worktree/branch name recorded in the dispatcher's `Agent Working` comment on that issue (`<LINEAR-ID>-<slug>`).

## Persistent service (launchd)

Template: `tools/dispatcher/launchd/com.moviecal.dispatcher.plist`. The filled-in copy that's actually loaded lives outside the repo at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.moviecal.dispatcher.plist` — same "runtime config lives outside the repo" pattern as `~/.config/moviecal/`.

**Runs out of a dedicated worktree, not the interactive main checkout.** `REPO_ROOT` (`tools/dispatcher/src/config.mjs`) self-resolves from wherever `dispatcher.mjs` physically lives — three directories up from the script's own path — so it's whatever directory the plist points at, no separate config needed. Pointing that at `/Users/adammoore/code/moviecal` (the checkout used for interactive local git work) would mean the daemon's own `git fetch`/`git worktree add`/`git branch -D`/`git push --delete` calls share a working directory with whatever the repo owner is doing there by hand. Instead, the installed plist points at a dedicated, non-interactive worktree: `/Users/adammoore/code/worktrees/moviecal/dispatcher-daemon` — never used for anything else, so the daemon's own git operations never collide with local interactive use. The dispatcher itself has zero external npm dependencies (everything under `tools/dispatcher/` imports only `node:*` builtins), so this worktree needs no `npm ci` — a bare `git worktree add` is sufficient.

**This worktree is not auto-updated.** Nothing currently pulls new commits into it on its own — if `tools/dispatcher/` changes on `master` after the service is running, the daemon keeps executing the orchestration code it started with indefinitely, without erroring (worker-spawned worktrees still branch from current `origin/master`, since `WorktreeManager.create()` fetches at creation time — only the dispatcher's own top-level logic goes stale). Whenever `tools/dispatcher/` changes: `cd` into `/Users/adammoore/code/worktrees/moviecal/dispatcher-daemon`, `git pull`, then restart the service (`launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.moviecal.dispatcher`). A self-updating daemon was deliberately not built here — that's its own supervision-model question, not something to fold in as a side effect of getting the base service running.

**Commands** (see the template's own header comment for the full list):

```
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.moviecal.dispatcher.plist     # start
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.moviecal.dispatcher.plist   # stop
launchctl list | grep com.moviecal.dispatcher                          # status
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.moviecal.dispatcher             # restart (e.g. after a git pull)
```

The plist's own `StandardOutPath`/`StandardErrorPath` (`~/Library/Logs/moviecal-dispatcher/dispatcher.std{out,err}.log`) capture only the dispatcher process's own top-level output — per-worker logs are still under `~/Library/Logs/moviecal-dispatcher/<LINEAR-ID>-<slug>/` as described above. `KeepAlive.SuccessfulExit: false` restarts the process on a crash or nonzero exit but not on a clean exit; `ThrottleInterval: 30` caps restart frequency if it's crash-looping.

**PATH.** launchd runs jobs with a minimal `PATH` (`/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`), not the interactive shell's `PATH`. `ProgramArguments` invokes node via an absolute path so the daemon process itself starts, but every child process the dispatcher or its workers spawn — `gh`, `npm`, `codex` (`/usr/local/bin`), `claude` (`~/.local/bin`) — fails with `ENOENT` unless the plist sets `PATH` explicitly. The template's `EnvironmentVariables` dict does this (`__HOME__/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`); keep it when filling in the installed copy. `dispatcher doctor` passing from an interactive shell does **not** prove the daemon's environment is correct — an interactive shell has a fuller `PATH` than launchd gives the job, so `doctor`'s `gh`/`claude`/`codex` checks can pass there while the running service still fails on the same lookups. After any `launchctl load`, confirm the service itself is working (check `dispatcher.stderr.log` and a run-log directory for a completed poll cycle), not just that `doctor` is clean in your terminal.

## Standing health check

`dispatcher doctor` is a read-only command that asserts: Linear auth works, `gh` auth works, the worktree root is writable, `~/.config/moviecal/env.local` exists and is mode 600, `claude` and `codex` are on `PATH`, `origin/master` is fetchable, and the iOS self-hosted runner is reachable. If `~/.config/moviecal/linear-app.env` is present it additionally checks the file is mode 600 and that an app-actor token can be minted from it (MOV-122); if it is absent that check is a no-op pass. Run it after any environment change and before relying on the dispatcher for real work.

## Known gaps / follow-ups

- Dispatch is currently poll-based (default 30s interval, `dispatcher run [--interval ms]`). A Linear Agent App (webhook-driven) is a planned follow-up, not yet implemented.
- `dispatcher run` is implemented and unit-tested against every outcome (preflight block, routing block, worker success, worker failure, worker exits 0 with no PR and a clean worktree, worker exits 0 with no PR and an `abandoned-dirty` worktree, spawn error), but has not yet been exercised against the live Linear workspace — that first real run is migration Stage 10 (end-to-end verification), tracked in `docs/planning/decision-log.md`.
- Docker is not installed on this Mac, so `npm run lane:real-stack` / `lane:full-stack` stay CI-only locally; use the `supabase-verify` GitHub Actions workflow as the authoritative DB gate.
- MOV-115 (two-way GitHub sync) is **done** — see `docs/governance/linear-information-architecture.md` §GitHub Issues: migration and ongoing sync.
- MOV-116 (an automated `lane-review` status check for independent PR scrutiny, plus wiring `security-policy.mjs`'s hard-deny list into real enforcement) is partially done — see §Security model above. `lane-review` is now a required status check (MOV-119); the hard-deny-enforcement half is still unresolved.
